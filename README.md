MobileTasker
============

This mobile tasker app allows users to list their tasks and sync it with Google Tasks.

Users input put a date a task must be done by and set an urgency range by a percentage of days or manually setting the beginning. The urgency range defines when the task is imminent and has to be done soon. This arouses a sense of urgency before the task needs to be done. Sometimes, tasks may take a couple days to do, so this is another reason why a flexible urgency range is useful. The default will have an 80% urgency range.

When tasks are completed, hitting the checkbox will move the task and date finished from the task list to the task history.

The app focuses on three colours: green, yellow, and red. Usually, the task will be green. When the date enters the urgency range, the task will turn yellow. When the end date passes, the task turns red.

Tasks are ordered by the next due.
